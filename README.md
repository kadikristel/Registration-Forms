General project description We have a simple project with 2 similar registration forms (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack is used).

Using those registration forms we will not only cover the basic functionality of Cypress but also make an introduction to the main parts of front-end architecture.

We have a Web page that consists of 2 different registration forms. Registration forms allow people to enter their data for registering them as users on the Web page.

The registration forms are partially covered by the automation tests, which ensure that forms are working and all workflows and elements on the forms are working, though some parts are not tested at all. Also, some parts of the automated tests for the second form intentionally contain some bugs, so automated tests are not working properly and need to be fixed.

Expected project outcomes:

    • Form 1 is covered with tests: 
        ⁕ Some tests need to be updated to understand the basic structure of the test. 
        ⁕ Additional tests should be created

    • Form 2 is covered with tests: 
        ⁕ All existing tests for the second registration form are working properly. Bugs in the code are discovered and fixed. 
        ⁕ Additional functional tests are created 
        ⁕ Additional visual tests are created
